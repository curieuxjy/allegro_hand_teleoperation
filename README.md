# allegro_hand_teleoperation

Teleoperation Application Code for the Allegro Hand Platforms

This repository provides a teleoperation framework for the Allegro Hand (V4 series).
The core feature is **hand retargeting**, which converts glove-based or vision-based inputs into Allegro Hand joint commands.

> [!NOTE]
> This project provides **Hand Teleoperation code only**.
> **Robot Arm Teleoperation must be developed separately.**

## Dependency: Allegro Hand ROS2 Controller

This project operates based on the official controller:

### 👉 [Wonik Robotics-git/allegro_hand_ros2](https://github.com/Wonik Robotics-git/allegro_hand_ros2)

Make sure to set up the Allegro Hand ROS2 controller before using this teleoperation code.

### Setup Instructions

```bash
# Build the package
colcon build --packages-select allegro_hand_ros2

# Source the workspace
source install/setup.bash

# CAN setup
./start_one_hand.sh              # For single hand
./start_two_hands.sh             # For dual-hand setup

# Run the controller
ros2 launch allegro_hand_bringup allegro_hand.launch.py      # Single hand
ros2 launch allegro_hand_bringup allegro_hand_duo.launch.py  # Dual hands
```

### Controller Topic Names

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Controller command topics differ based on setup:
> - **Single hand:** `allegro_hand_position_controller/commands`
> - **Dual hands:** `allegro_hand_position_controller_r/commands` and `allegro_hand_position_controller_l/commands`
>
> Ensure your teleoperation code uses the correct topic names.
